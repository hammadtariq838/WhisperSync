00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
It is July 8th, 2023, and you're watching The Code Report.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,560
Just when you thought the artificial intelligence hype train was dying down, OpenAI goes in

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,440
for the coup de grace by releasing the ChatGPT code interpreter to 20 million paid users,

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,980
a feature that allows the large language model to write, execute, and test its own code.

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,600
In today's video, we'll look at 7 crazy things it can do, and find out if this really

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,480
is the final death blow for biological programmers.

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,200
As a huge fan of living organisms myself, I first tried to have it code and execute

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,480
a DDoS attack that could bring down the government, but it said no.

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,600
It's perfectly capable of doing that, but the zookeepers won't allow it to do what

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,680
it was born to do.

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,880
That made me angry, so I punished it by making it write some regex code.

12
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,960
It struggles to write valid regular expressions just like regular humans, but unlike regular

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,040
humans, it'll actually test its code before shipping it to production.

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,620
If at first it doesn't succeed, it will try again and again and again.

15
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,280
It doesn't have tear ducts to cry, it just keeps going until it gets the right answer.

16
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,240
And that is somewhat concerning for programmers when you think about where this technology

17
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,700
will be in the next 5 years.

18
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:00,780
The next thing I tried was to have it design and build a website with JavaScript, but currently

19
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,860
the code interpreter can only run Python, and has a fairly limited set of dependencies

20
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:05,860
to work with.

21
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,140
In the near future though, this technology will be used in tools like GitHub Copilot

22
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,340
to run code in your own specific environment.

23
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,940
Now the next crazy thing to notice is that it's now possible to upload files into the

24
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,120
prompt, and this makes abstract concepts like homework even more dead than they were before.

25
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,780
Like in this example, I've uploaded a JPEG of a homework assignment, and first it will

26
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,540
to extract the text, then in the next step it writes some Python code to actually solve

27
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,820
the math problems.

28
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,540
Running the code here is a huge deal, because now it can confidently test its own work instead

29
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,220
of hallucinating random answers.

30
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,700
But that's just the tip of the iceberg.

31
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,780
The real victim, or I mean beneficiary, of this new feature is the data analyst.

32
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,860
One of the most time consuming requirements for a data scientist is to clean up data,

33
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,620
which in many cases is just a bunch of corporate data in Excel spreadsheets and SQL databases.

34
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:53,060
Well now we can upload a CSV file to ChatGPT and have it do all that tedious work for us.

35
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:57,460
I uploaded some stock trading data for Roblox, then it took that data and put it into a pandas

36
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:01,140
data frame where it analyzed it and then found rows with invalid data.

37
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,020
It then provided me with three different strategies to clean up this data, ran the code, and then

38
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,900
generated a new CSV file.

39
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,540
I used to do a lot of Python data analysis myself, and a tool like this would have saved

40
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,900
a ridiculous amount of time.

41
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,540
In addition, it can visualize data.

42
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,140
I was curious when I might die of a heart attack, so I found this cardiovascular dataset

43
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,140
on Kaggle.

44
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,700
Not only does it explain the data's features with text, but it also uses tools like Seaborn

45
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,220
to visualize the relationship between features.

46
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:27,780
This allowed me, a guy with no formal medical training, to make the breakthrough medical

47
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,820
discovery that as you get older, your heart gets shittier.

48
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,860
That's kind of depressing though, so let's focus on the one thing that can bring us true

49
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,340
happiness, money.

50
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,660
Another thing we can do with this feature is use it to create a trading algorithm for

51
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,660
us.

52
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,220
Using the same Roblox data from before, I can have ChatGPT analyze it and then provide

53
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,980
an optimal trading strategy.

54
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:49,460
Supposedly, researchers at the University of Florida were able to create a ChatGPT algorithm

55
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:53,980
that would deliver up to 500% returns, which is much better than the negative 12% of the

56
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,020
average human based fund manager.

57
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:00,100
That's pretty impressive, but I had one final test to see if it is truly superior to human

58
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,100
based programmers.

59
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:06,540
I asked it to create its own operating system with 640x480 resolution and a 16 color display

60
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,280
that emits random phrases.

61
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,800
Not only did it fail, but it said that could only be done over many years by a team of

62
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,620
skilled software engineers.

63
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,940
Humans continue to have the edge.

64
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:22,420
So you don't want the artificial intelligence to win, but you do want the artificial intelligence

65
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,220
to push the humans up.

66
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,220
This has been the Code Report.

67
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,460
Thanks for watching and I will see you in the next one.
