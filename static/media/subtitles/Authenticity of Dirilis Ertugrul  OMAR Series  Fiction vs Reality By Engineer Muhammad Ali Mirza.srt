1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This drama of Ertugrul Ghazi, which has hundreds of episodes,

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
the person who wrote the drama, ask him himself,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
he says that after digging through the entire history,

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I found hardly 4 pages on Ertugrul,

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
that who was he?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And he has made more than 400 episodes.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And in those 400 episodes, thousands of characters,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
hundreds of incidents of Samoa have been included.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And the person who wrote it, he says that he found 4 pages.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So ask him that you have made 4 lakh pages.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Not 4000.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Start writing from that episode.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So he says that I have designed it myself,

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
presented it as a drama.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
But the Pakistani people have understood that this is what happened.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
That is, this happened with Ertugrul in this way.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Now you will say that I have seen it myself, this was happening.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Our youth who sleep after watching Hollywood movies in millions,

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
we will tell them to watch the Umar series too.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
So that you know what are the real heroes of Islam.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And then the consultants of the Umar series are not stupid scholars.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
They are the top of the list scholars in the world.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The rest are just scholars with degrees, they are real researchers.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Who are considered to be non-believers and Muslim authorities.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Number one, Yusuf Al-Qardawi.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
He is 90 plus age.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Mufti Azam Qatar, he is his consultant.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
His students are Dr. Ali Silabi,

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
whose Daruslam-e-Hadith has published such thick books.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Dr. Ali Silabi has published the biography of Hazrat Abu Bakr, Umar, Usman, Ali, etc.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
He is his student.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
He is a consultant.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Mufti Azam is Saudi Arabian, he is not at the level of knowledge.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It is okay if you talk about someone else.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
These are the people.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
These are the people whose books are taught by Arab scholars.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
In Islam, Halal and Haram is the book of Yusuf Al-Qardawi.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Which you can consider as the only recognized book on modern age issues.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
In modern age issues, only one book has been written in the world,

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
that is Halal and Haram in Islam.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It has been translated into Urdu.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And this is taught to the scholars in Saudi Arabia as a textbook.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And this is written by Yusuf Al-Qardawi, who is a consultant of the Umar series.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I am telling you his level of knowledge.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And Yusuf Al-Qardawi has the honor of teaching the funeral of Mullah Muddudi.

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
There was so much disagreement as to who was going to teach the funeral.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Imam-e-Kaaba was also eager.

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Because the first award given to Dr. Zakir Naik in 2015 was given to Mullah Muddudi.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But then there was a consensus that Dr. Zakir Naik, who is no greater than Yusuf Al-Qardawi,

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
will teach the funeral.

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
In Qazafi Stadium.

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The biggest funeral of Mullah Muddudi in Pakistan's history has been given.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And Yusuf Al-Qardawi taught it.

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And he also writes to Mullah Muddudi as Al-Imam and quotes his references.

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Now he is 90 plus years old.

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So he is that consultant.

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Therefore, we say that the children of our Muslims,

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
who you will give to read Islamic history, no one reads the books.

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Our lecturers see the books, but no one reads them.

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I say that I have recorded a lecture on the life of the Prophet,

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
which was recorded in two hours, and there are 500 pages in the book,

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
but no one will read it.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But this lecture has been seen by millions of people.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So we say that those people,

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
we do not give you advice, you watch the Umar series.

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Those who already watch the films, must watch it.

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You also watch it.

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So in my opinion, there is no harm in it.

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Except that you pay attention to the women's scene.

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Otherwise, it is a very less scene.

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Most of the scenes are very positive.
