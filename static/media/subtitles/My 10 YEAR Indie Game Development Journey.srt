00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
Exactly 10 years ago to the day I uploaded my first video on this YouTube channel,

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,760
which was a little devlog video about my first ever game project that I'd just started a few

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,040
months earlier. A decade later and I'm still making games and devlog videos,

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,600
so to celebrate this milestone I want to take you through that 10 year journey,

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,920
from that very first game that I made as a hobby in my university dorm room,

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,520
to releasing my first commercial game and becoming a full time indie game developer.

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,240
To start the story though we need to go back a little further than 10 years, to the end of 2012

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,600
where I'd just had the idea for a game that, at the time, I thought was such a good idea

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,240
that I needed to learn how to make games just so that I could make that game.

10
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,280
I was 20 years old at the time and I'd just finished my second year at university,

11
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,760
where I was studying computer science, so I knew the basics of programming,

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,720
but apart from the coursework they set us I'd never really attempted any big projects before.

13
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,520
So, full of enthusiasm about my new idea for a game, I googled
