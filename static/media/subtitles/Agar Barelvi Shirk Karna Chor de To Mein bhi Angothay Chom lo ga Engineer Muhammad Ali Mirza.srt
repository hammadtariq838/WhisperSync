1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
If you call yourself a Hussaini, then why are you bound by the laws of the system of

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
falsehood?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Because my brother, Hazrat Yahya A.S. and Hazrat Zakri A.S. were alive in the rule of

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
the Romans.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That's why they died.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
They used to sit in the Temple of Solomon and do the work of Dawah-e-Tauheed in their

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
time.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
They didn't clash with the system of falsehood, nor did they change the system.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
They conveyed the message of Tauheed to the people.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So that when I have such strength, then I can clash with the system of falsehood, which

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
later people clashed with again.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So you have to look at that time.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So the system of falsehood, the system of falsehood that you are understanding, the

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
immediate meaning of falsehood comes from the establishment or political parties.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This is not the system of falsehood.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The system of falsehood is the sects of centuries.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The system of falsehood is those fathers who divided one Allah, one Prophet, one Qur'an

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
believer into so many sects.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So there is only one platform in the world that is against them.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We are the ones who are against the system of falsehood.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
When the Ummah does not pray, when the Tauheed of the Ummah is not correct, what do you have

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
to do by giving it the Islamic system?

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Will Barelvi stop saying Ya Ali Madad or Ya Sheikh Abdul Qadir Jilani Madad as soon

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
as he steals and his hands are cut off?

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So by implementing the Islamic system, will there be a difference in his belief?

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Will he stop being faithful when the hands of Ahl-e-Hadith are cut off for stealing?

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And will he become a believer of Maulana Ali?

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
No.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The purification of the faith is through narratives, doctrines, and the arguments of the Qur'an

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and Sunnah.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Nothing happens by changing the system.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
My brother, how strong is your army?

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
If you bring the head of this army and make him a strict Salafi Wahabi, he cannot break

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
even one court of Pakistan.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
They will skin him alive.

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The present army chief, there was no propaganda about him that he is a Qadiani.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
He got the ticket at night and went to Umrah.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
From there, he shared his pictures.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He invited the Maulvis of the neighborhood and held gatherings in his house.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
More than this, he kissed the fingers during the assembly meeting so that Barelvi gets

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
a degree.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And he got it.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Hanif Qureshi Sahab said proudly that when the assembly meeting was taking place, Bajwa

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Sahab kissed the fingers.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:56,000
My friend, if Barelvi is ready to leave Shirk on kissing the fingers, then I will also kiss

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
the fingers.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Our real problem with you is that we do not object to you.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Our objection is on Deobandis.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Because the book of Fiqh is one of Deobandis and Barelvis.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It is called Futawa Shami.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It is written in the book Durr-e-Mukhtar that we should kiss the fingers on the name of

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
the Prophet.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So, we definitely object to the Deobandis that you are hitting a stick in Hanifiyat

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and you should kiss the fingers.

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So, they say that this Deen is not right.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So, sir, how many Deens are not right in Fazal-e-Maal?

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
How many Deens are not right in Deobandis?
