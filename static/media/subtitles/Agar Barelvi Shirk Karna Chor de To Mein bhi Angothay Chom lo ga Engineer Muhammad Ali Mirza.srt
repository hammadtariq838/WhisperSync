1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
If you call yourself a Hussaini, then why are you bound by the laws of the system of falsehood?

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Because my brother, Hazrat Yahya A.S. and Hazrat Zakri A.S. were alive in the rule of the Romans,

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
that's why they died.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:28,000
They used to sit in the Temple of Suleiman, Haikal-e-Sulmani and do the work of Dawah-e-Tauheed.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
They didn't fight with the system of falsehood and didn't change the system.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
They spread the message of Tauheed to the people, so that when I have such strength,

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
then I can fight with the system of falsehood, which later people fought with.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So, you have to look at that time.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So, the system of falsehood, the system of falsehood that you are understanding,

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
from the system of falsehood, your immediate aim is establishment or political parties.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
This is not the system of falsehood.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The system of falsehood is a sect of centuries.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The system of falsehood is the sect of those who have divided one Allah, one Prophet,

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
one believer of the Quran into so many sects.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So, there is only one platform against them in the world, which is up.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We are the ones who are against the system of falsehood.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
When the Ummah doesn't pray, when the Tauheed of the Ummah is not correct,

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
what do you have to do by giving it the system of Islam?

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Will the one who steals and his hands are cut off,

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
as soon as his hands are cut off, he will stop saying Ya Ali Madad or Ya Sheikh Abdul Qadir Jilani Madad?

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So, by implementing the Islamic punishment, will there be a difference in his belief?

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
When the hands of the Ahl-e-Hadith are cut off for stealing,

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
will he stop being a believer?

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And will he become a believer of Maulana Ali?

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
No.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The purification of Aqeedah is done through narratives, doctrines, statements,

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and the arguments of the Quran and Sunnah.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Nothing happens by changing the system.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
My brother, how strong is your army?

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
If you bring the head of this army and make him a firm Salafi Wahabi,

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
he can break even one Darbar of Pakistan.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He will remove the skin and keep it.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The present army chief,

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
wasn't there any propaganda about him that he is a Qadiani?

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
He got the ticket at night and went for Umrah.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
From there, he shared his pictures.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And he invited the Maulvis of the neighborhood and held gatherings in his house.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
More than this, he kissed the fingers in the assembly meeting,

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
so that he can get a degree in Braille.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
And he gave it.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Hanif Qureshi Sahab said proudly,

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
When the assembly was being held,

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Bajwa Sahab kissed the fingers.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
If Braille is ready to leave Shirk on kissing the fingers,

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
then I will also kiss the fingers.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Our real problem with you is that

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
we don't have any objection against you.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Our objection is against the Deobandis.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Because the book of Fiqh is one of the Deobandis and Braillemis,

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Fatawa Shami.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It is written in it that the fingers should be kissed on the name of the Prophet.

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So we definitely object against the Deobandis,

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
that you are hitting a stick in Hanifiyyat,

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
you should kiss the fingers.

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You say that this Deen is not right.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So sir, how many Deens are not right in Fazal-e-Maal?

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Your Deen is not right, you give a Dars.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You say that Braillemis are not right,

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
you give a Vidal Panjan.
